# cloud-based-platform
Cloud-based IoT platform architecture using Docker, cloud services, and microservices for device data ingestion, processing, and monitoring.
# Cloud-Based IoT Architecture

IoT devices send data to cloud APIs.
The data is processed using microservices and visualized on a dashboard.

## Components
- IoT Devices
- Cloud API Service
- Data Processing Service
- Dashboard Service
  # Cloud-Based IoT Platform

This project demonstrates a cloud-based IoT platform architecture using Docker and microservices.

## Overview
IoT devices send data to cloud services where it is processed and visualized through a dashboard.

## Services
- Device Service (data ingestion)
- Data Processing Service
- Dashboard Service

## Technologies Used
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Cloud Architecture
- Python (Flask)
- Microservices

## Architecture Flow
IoT Devices → Cloud API → Data Processing → Dashboard

## Features
- Scalable cloud-based design
- Microservices architecture
- Containerized services using Docker

## Use Case
- Smart devices
- Sensor data collection
- Cloud monitoring systems
